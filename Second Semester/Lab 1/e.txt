Billionaires have been cast as villains, symbols of all that ails the free market.

Populist rage isn't about economic inequality, but rather people's belief that their dignity and worth are being trampled on by uncaring, globalized elites, as Francis Fukuyama compellingly argued in his 2018 book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment. Throwing money at them would be like pouring gasoline on a fire.
